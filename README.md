So, what's Synapse all about? It's a mobile app built to fight **Cognitive Offloading** In a world where AI has all the answers, we dare to ask the right questions.

## The Idea: What's Our Deal with **Cognitive Offloading**? 🤔

Let's be real: we live in a world of instant answers! AI can write, code, and create in a snap, but this has a sneaky downside: cognitive offloading. We're letting our tech do the heavy lifting for our brains. When we constantly hand off the work of reasoning and problem-solving, our own mental skills can get a little rusty.

Synapse is our way of fighting back! It's our answer to this super important issue in our digital age.

## The Solution: A Training Ground for Your Mind 🧘

Most apps just spit out answers. Synapse is different; we help you come up with your own.

To be clear: we're not anti-AI, we're just against over-relying on it. 

**We believe AI should be like a calculator --a tool that helps you focus on the big picture, not a replacement for your own thinking. 🛠️**

Our whole philosophy is simple: Use AI to help your brain grow, not to replace it. Our AI acts as a friendly guide, throwing you interesting challenges that don't have a single right answer and giving you a cool space to think it all through.

## How It Works ⚙️

- ### The Provocation: 
We hit you with a fun, tricky question from a topic you care about. It's a real brain-teaser meant to get you thinking!

- ### The Blank Canvas: 
You get a clean space to just... think. We even track your "Thinking Time" to celebrate the effort you're putting in. ⏳

- ### The Hint: 
Feeling stuck? Our AI won't give you the answer. Instead, it'll ask you another clever question to get your brain moving again. 🤫

- ### The Personal Dashboard: 
This is your personal journey! Your dashboard shows you how your thinking grows over time by tracking your streaks and mindful minutes. 📈
